# üß† Dynamic NFT-Backed Loan Smart Contract

## Overview

This Clarity smart contract enables **NFT-collateralized lending** with a unique twist:
the **NFT‚Äôs attributes dynamically evolve** based on the **loan‚Äôs repayment status**.

Borrowers can list their NFTs as collateral for loans, while lenders can offer funds based on agreed terms. The NFT is held by the contract during the loan term and can change properties such as **rarity**, **power-level**, or **condition** depending on borrower behavior.

This creates a DeFi + NFT hybrid system where reputation and financial responsibility are reflected in the asset itself.

## ‚ú® Features

* **NFT Loan Listing** ‚Äî List NFTs as collateral for potential loans.

* **Secure Custody** ‚Äî NFTs are transferred to the contract during active loans.
* **Loan Lifecycle Management** ‚Äî Tracks loan terms, repayments, and defaults.

### ü™ô Public Functions

#### 1. **Mint a New NFT**

```clarity
(define-public (mint-nft (recipient principal)))
```

**Description:**
Mints a new dynamic NFT with initial default attributes (`rarity`, `power-level`, and `condition` all set to 100).

**Returns:** `ok(token-id)` on success.
**Errors:** None (except internal minting failures).

---

#### 2. **List NFT for Loan**

```clarity
(define-public (list-nft-for-loan (token-id uint) (requested-amount uint) (min-duration uint) (max-interest uint)))
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

### 1. **Mint NFT**

User calls `mint-nft(recipient)` to create a new NFT with baseline attributes.

### 2. **List for Loan**

NFT owner calls `list-nft-for-loan(...)` specifying:

* Requested loan amount
* Minimum duration
* Maximum acceptable interest rate

### 3. **Offer Loan**

Lender calls `offer-loan(...)` with terms matching or exceeding borrower‚Äôs criteria:

* STX are sent to borrower
* NFT is escrowed in the contract
* Loan record is created

### 4. **Loan Lifecycle**

The contract records:

* Repayments
* Missed payments
* Defaulted status
* NFT attribute updates (to be implemented in extended version)

---

## üß† Dynamic NFT Logic (Conceptual Extension)

In a full version of this protocol, the NFT‚Äôs **attributes** (`rarity`, `power-level`, `condition`) would dynamically adjust:

* **Timely repayment:** Increases `rarity` and `power-level`.
* **Missed payments:** Reduces `condition` or other attributes.
* **Default:** NFT could lose certain traits or become ‚Äúdamaged.‚Äù

These behaviors are tracked via `missed-payments`, `total-repaid`, and `status` fields in `loan-details`.

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

* [ ] Add **repayment function** to allow periodic STX payments.
* [ ] Implement **loan default logic** (automatic NFT forfeiture).
* [ ] Add **dynamic attribute adjustments** on repayment events.
* [ ] Enable **NFT recovery or burn** upon default.
* [ ] Integrate with NFT marketplace for trading post-loan.
